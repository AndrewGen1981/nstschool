            <h2 class="code_importat">Attendance is an important part of any instruction. Absences can negatively affect the student’s progress. Excessive absences WILL be cause for termination.</h2>
            
            <h3 class="code-header">Excessive absences occur when two consecutive or (3)three total absences takes place.</h3>
            <p class="code-text">Unexcused absences occur when the student fails to explain the absences prior to that absence.
                If a student misses over 3 days of training, the school may recommend that the student reschedule
                the training to a future date. Rescheduled training will be conducted in one of two ways:
                If there is a vacancy in another ongoing session, the student may attend those missed modules. The
                missed modules, hours or subjects may be rescheduled at the school’s convenience.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="code-header">Warning/Drop</h3>
            <p class="code-text">The student will receive a warning letter after two un-excused absences. Unless arrangements are made with
                the school director, a student who has four absences will be sent a drop letter from our program. If the student
                fails to respond to the drop letter in a reasonable time, they will be dropped from the program.
            </p>

            <h3 class="code-header">Leave of Absence</h3>
            <p class="code-text">A student seeking a leave of absence must do so by notifying the School Director in writing. Students who are
                granted a leave of absence will be dropped from the school if the student does not re-enroll within 30 days. A
                leave of absence cannot exceed thirty (30) calendar days for regular leave or thirty (30) days for a verified
                medical reason. Only one leave of absence will be granted to each student.
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="code-header">Re-Admission</h3>
            <p class="code-text">New Sound Trucking School does not re-admit students who have been dropped from our course. Other
                circumstances will be dealt with on an individual basis.
